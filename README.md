# DS5500--Homework 1

# Question: 1:
Gapminder test: I scored 7/13. In most cases I was more optimistic about the world and the reality showed harsh facts.
Question that I found to be interesting is:

Actual Question: What is the life expectancy of the world population?
Answer: 70 years, this sounds like a good number, how has this changed through years?
Restated Question: How has the life expectancy varied through years?

There have been huge drops in historical life expectancy values, these could be due to unexpected wars, famines. In earlier years we can see that life expectancy has been very low compared to recent years, this might be linked to lack of proper health and living conditions. But, it is a very positive sign that life expectancy has improved a lot in recent years.


# Question: 2:

Interpretations: We can notice from above visualization that there has been tremendous increase in income across select countries while there are countries that have not shown much improvement across the spread of time. America and europe have noticeably had very positive change through the years whereas africa and most of asia have not shown huge improvements. There has been massive increase in select middle eastern countries in mid 1900's like saudi arabia, qatar, and Iran, this might be due to the rise in oil production and consumption


# Question: 3:

Interpretation: We can see that life expectancy and gdp are directly proportional, whereas life expectancy and mortality rates are inversely proportional. When it comes to child mortality, europe seems to be the best performer while africa has made the most progress in bringing down the numbers but still has a long way to go. In both gdp and life expectancy america and asia seem to be equally performing countries whereas europe has outperformed other countries. GDP increase means that countries wealth is improving which results in better living and health conditions and hence results in increase of life expectancy and decrease in mortality rates.


# Question: 4:

Interpretation: From the above graphs we get a mixed understanding as there is no clear indicator that governments have made significant progress in eradicating malaria. Because the number of malaria cases have gone up which means prevention and awareness methods have failed inspite of proactively campaigning about malaria. On the other hand we can see that malaria deaths have seen a huge drop across the years, which means that treatment methods have been successul like vaccinations.


# Question: 5:

Answer: I have used static plots, as in this case keeping it simple for the user would be the best way to give the takeaway. For 2nd question inorder to understand distribution of per capita income across different countries and continents, I have used several chloropleth plots and generated a gif, which shows value variations across each country and continent using colors as time passes. Required relationships and trends could be explained and identified using static plots in our cases.

Advantages of interactive plots: When multiple variables are present and the number of combination of visualizations that need to be looked at are more in number we can use interactive visualization so as to give the user a better view. Static plots cannot be used in this case as large number of static plots are required to convey the same message as an interactive plot

Advantages of static plots: When number of variables in play are less then the key takeaways can be kept simple to give the user best possible understanding. When plots have to be given as a physical copy then interactive plots cannot be used, in these cases static plots are best suited
